                        <p><b>Luffy and the Strawhats came into a family of Celestial Dragons at the Sabaody auction house while trying to save Caime.<br> <br>His ambition to buy Caime and put her in an aquarium with piranhas made punching the concerned Celestial Dragon reasonable. But because Hanchi didn't want to start a fight, he restrained Luffy. 
                            However, Hanchi was obliged to hit Luffy because he had shot him multiple times simply because he could. The Celestial Dragon called Hanchi less than human and laughed at the injured Fishman. Luffy is a terrific friend who hates being severe, as everyone knows.</b></p>

                            It became a bit clearer when Luffy walked through the dumbstruck crowd, laid flowers into the chasm and removed his hat in a gesture of respect. Okay, I thought, this is funeral stuff. He’s returning to Marineford to pay his respects to Ace. This was to give Luffy closure so he could continue to live his life without being crippled by guilt and depression.</b></p>

                    <p>The Worst Generation is a term referring to twelve infamous pirates who emerged immediately before the beginning of the Summit War of Marineford. They consist of the eleven super rookies present at the Sabaody Archipelago just before said war, and the then-Warlord Blackbeard, who gained the title following his victory over Ace during the Duel on Banaro Island.[2] They are notorious for the bold actions they committed against the World Government and have bounties of over 100,000,000 Beli</p>
